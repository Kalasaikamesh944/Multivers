# Multiverse Theories: Formulas and Concepts

This document outlines some key theoretical formulas related to the multiverse, a concept spanning quantum mechanics, cosmology, and string theory.

## 1. Quantum Mechanics and Many-Worlds Interpretation
**Schrödinger's Equation:**
\[
i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \Psi
\]
- Governs the wavefunction \Psi, which branches into multiple universes upon measurement in the Many-Worlds Interpretation.

## 2. Inflationary Multiverse (Cosmic Inflation Theory)
**Friedmann Equation:**
\[
H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{k}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda}{3}
\]
- Describes the dynamics of the universe, where inflation can create separate universes with different properties.

## 3. String Theory Landscape
**Vacuum States in String Theory:**
\[
N \sim 10^{500}
\]
- Predicts a vast number of possible vacuum states (N), each representing a unique universe.

## 4. Entropy and Black Hole Multiverse
**Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy:**
\[
S = \frac{k c^3 A}{4 \hbar G}
\]
- Describes black hole entropy, with speculative links to the formation of new universes.

---

## 5. Anthropic Principle
**Probability of Observing a Universe:**
\[
P(U) = \int_{\Omega} P(\Lambda, \alpha, \beta, ...) \, d\Lambda \, d\alpha \, d\beta \, ...
\]
- Estimates the likelihood of a universe suitable for life by integrating over the parameter space of physical constants.

## 6. Ekpyrotic Universe Model
**Brane Collision:**
\[
S_{\text{total}} = S_{\text{brane}} + S_{\text{bulk}}
\]
- Suggests that our universe formed from the collision of two 3D branes.

---

## 7. Observable Universe and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
**Perturbation Growth:**
\[
\delta(t) \propto t^{\frac{2}{3}}
\]
- Describes the growth of perturbations in the early universe, potentially connected to multiverse origins.
